    "- **Outcome Variable:** `stroke` (occurrence rate: 4.9%)  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Patient Demographics and Profile\n",
    "- **Mean Age:** 43 years (range: 0–82)  \n",
    "- **Average BMI:** 28.9 (with some missing entries)  \n",
    "- Many patients show low physical activity and have conditions like hypertension or heart disease  \n",

    "- **Data Type Considerations:**  \n",
    "  - `bmi` recorded as text instead of numeric  \n",
    "  - Categorical variables such as `gender`, `ever_married`, and `work_type` need proper encoding  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inconsistencies in Values:**  \n",
    "  - `smoking_status` has multiple categories such as “formerly smoked”, “never smoked”, and “Unknown” that require standardization  \n",

    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "- Stroke occurrence is low (4.9%), suggesting an imbalanced dataset; this must be addressed during modeling  \n",
    "- Factors such as age, BMI, and comorbidities (hypertension, heart disease) are likely influential  \n",
